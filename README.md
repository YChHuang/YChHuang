# Hi, I'm Chieh 👋

## Game Developer | UE5 Programmer |

## 🎮 About Me

Gameplay programmer passionate about building engaging game mechanics.
My 2D art background allows me to:
- Visualize and prototype complete game features independently
- Create and refine concept art that bridges design and technical implementation
- Communicate effectively with both art and programming teams

📌 這樣的版本突出了 Concept Art 的能力（構思、橋接設計與技術），同時保留了程式面向的專業。
要不要我再幫你做一個「更偏向技術導向」的版本，把 Programmer 放在前面，然後用 Concept Art 當輔助技能，讓不同場合可以切換使用？

- Communicate effectively with both art and programming team

Currently focused on UE5 gameplay systems.
